# CS2001 Team 23
The aim of this project is to plan, manage and track a large group development activity. We have been instructed to take an open-ended problem and develop a non-trivial application that will aid in solving the issue. 

The application we have decided to develop is a travel booking program that allows users to book multiple legs of a trip at the same time. From our market research, there is no application that allows multiple bookings within one order and trip. The group has decided this will be developed as an android app. This repo will contain all the documents and program files utilised and developed within the course of this project.
